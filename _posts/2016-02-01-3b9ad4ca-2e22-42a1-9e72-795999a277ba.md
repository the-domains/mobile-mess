There are a lot of reasons why websites are messes on mobile devices, but one reasons stands over and above the rest... **fixed-width designs**.

## Size Matters ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1dff0071-fdad-47f0-8bd6-3fa9cc15e858.png)

If you were designing a poster, the first thing you would ask is "How big do you want the poster?". Your poster design is going to vary depending on the size. A billboard and a postcard are designed very differently.

Now imagine that you were asked to design a billboard and they ended up printing it on a postcard. The design won't translate very well, words will be too small, subtle elements that were 2 feet long are now only 2 inches long. It's a mess. And it's because your design was printed on the wrong size.

This is exactly what happens with a lot of web pages. They are designed to fit on big screens and then get viewed on small screens. 

**What is a fixed-width design? **

A fixed-width design is when the design is told to be exactly the same width, no matter what size the screen is. If you made your billboard design 10ft wide no matter what size the actual billboard was, you'd run into problems. If the billboard was 20ft wide, you'd have a lot of blank space. If it was 5ft wide, you'd only get half the design. Your design is fixed-width.

Smartphones and tablets are a little smarter than billboards. If the fixed-width design of the website is too big, in most cases, the phone will zoom-out on the design until the whole website will fit. But when you zoom out - everything gets smaller. When you go to a site on your phone and everything is too small to read - this is what is happening. 

**What is the solution?**

The opposite of a fixed-width design is a responsive design; a design that responds to the size of the device that is being used. If the screen is small, it uses a small design. If the screen is big, it uses a big design. It's responsive! There are many frameworks for building responsive websites (google "responsive design framework") and they are becoming more and more popular. If you are going to do a redesign, using one of these frameworks is a must.

However, many websites are being left in the dust-bin of history because of their fixed-width design and other design mistakes. Your website may be among them. Often the only solution that is given is to start over from scratch - and that is a hard camel to swallow. The time, energy, training, and money required for a new website is often out of reach for businesses.

**But there is another way.**

The technology exists to clean up messy mobile sites without doing a full-redesign. The nature of modern web design and scripting gives us the tools we need in order to fix the problems that exists in the current design; without the pains of redesigning and relearning.
